## Talisay City College Website

This website was developed for our Talisay City College research proposal. Although this isn't Talisay City College's official website, it serves as a sneak preview of how technologically behind our institution is and how soon it will be compelled to create its website in order to compete with other institutions that allow students to access real-time information.
